Beef Wellington is a steak dish of English origin, 
made out of fillet steak coated with pâté (often pâté de foie gras) 
and duxelles, <strong>wrapped</strong> in puff pastry, then baked. 
Some recipes include wrapping the coated meat in a crêpe or parma ham 
to retain the moisture and prevent it from making the pastry soggy.

<p>A whole tenderloin may be wrapped and baked, and then sliced for serving, 
    or the tenderloin may be sliced into individual portions 
    prior to wrapping and baking. </p>
