<h1>BEEF WELLINGTON</h1>


<p>Beef Wellington is a steak dish of English origin,
    made out of fillet steak coated with pâté (often pâté de foie gras)
    and duxelles, <strong>wrapped</strong> in puff pastry, then baked. </p>

<p> recipes include wrapping the coated meat in a crêpe or parma ham
    to retain the moisture and prevent it from making the pastry soggy.</p>

<p>A whole tenderloin may be wrapped and baked, and then sliced for serving,
    or the tenderloin may be sliced into individual portions
    prior to wrapping and baking. </p>
